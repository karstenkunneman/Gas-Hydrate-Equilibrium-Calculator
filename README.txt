A Web Python-Based Tool for the Prediction of Natural Gas Hydrates Equilibrium and Inhibition.
Developed by Karsten Kunneman in collaboratonb with Prof. Amadeu K. Sum at the Colorado School of Mines

This tool is designed to determine the equilibrium conditions for a given single- or multiple-component
hydrate system, including systems in the presence of inhibitors (alcohols, glycols, and salts). 
Additional functionality is available to estimate the concentrations of a given inhibitor required to 
reduce the temperatures required for equilibrium to a certain pressure (betaGas for a given equilibrium 
curve can also be estimated).

This tool is based primarily on the following models:
 - Phase behavior of clathrate hydrates: a model for single and multiple gas component hydrates
   by J. B. Klauda and S. I. Sandler [doi: 10.1021/ie000322b]
 - Universal correlation for gas hydrates suppression temperature of inhibited systems: III. salts and 
   organic inhibitors by Y. Hu, J.-H. Sa, B. R. Lee, and A. K. Sum [doi: 10.1002/aic.16369]
