A Web Python-Based Tool for the Prediction of Natural Gas Hydrates Equilibrium and Inhibition
Built by Karsten Kunneman and Dr. Amadeu K. Sum at the Colorado School of Mines

This tool is designed to determine the equilibrium conditions for a given single- or multiple-component
hydrate system, including systems with the presence of inhibitors. Additional functionality exists to
estimate the concentrations of a given inhibitor required to reduce the temperatures required for
equilibrium to a certain point, and the betaGas for a given equilibrium curve can also be estimated.

This software is based primarily on the following models:
 - Phase behavior of clathrate hydrates: a model for single and multiple gas component hydrates
   by Jeffery B. Klauda and Stanley I. Sandler
 - Universal correlation for gas hydrates suppression temperature of inhibited systems: III. salts and 
   organic inhibitors by Yue Hu, Jeong-Hoon Sa, Bo Ram Lee, and Amadeu K. Sum
