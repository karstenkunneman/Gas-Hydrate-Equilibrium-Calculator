1. Fixed betaGas calculations
2. Equilibrium temperature inhibition no longer occurs below the freezing point of water
3. Added Celsius and Rankine temperature units
4. Added bar and mmHg pressure units
5. Allows user to select from preset betaGas types instead of numbers
6. Added watermark onto graphs
7. Shows user data without occupancy data but now allows for download of full data
8. Commandline now correctly gives user option to automatically or manually determine betaGas
