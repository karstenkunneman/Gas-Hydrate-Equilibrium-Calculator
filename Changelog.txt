1. Fixed an issue on the commandline program that would cause the calculation time to continue if the betaGas calculation fails and the user is prompted for manual input
2. Fixed an issue on the commandline program that would give T and P values of incorrect orders of magnitude when obtaining equilibrium Temperatures
3. Fixed temperature rounding on both the commandline program and web app
4. Fixed numerous issues with equilibrium temperature calculations on both commandline and webapp programs, both should be working as intended
5. Implemented functionality for the commandline to handle nonuniform composition calculations
6. Fixed a bug where the inhibited temperature may not round correctly
7. Commandline will now round occupancies to 4 decimals
