1. Webapp now correctly requests weight percent instead of weight fraction of inhibitors from user
2. Preset guess temperatures now autoconvert to selected temperature and pressure
3. Removed options for Rankine and mmHg temperature and pressure
4. Fixed an issue where nonstandard units would not graph properly with the inhibited temperature line
5. Overhauled the P/T guess algorithm to guess different temperatures for IHV and LHV using a two-term fit
6. Altered the formatting of graphs to be more presentable
7. Fixed a large number of miscellaneous GUI bugs
8. Fixed an issue where the input temperature and pressure units were not hardcoded to K and MPa
9. Removed O2 and H2S data
