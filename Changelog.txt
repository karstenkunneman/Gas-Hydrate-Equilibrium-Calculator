1. Improved the speed of guest-guest interaction parameter calculation, reducing calculation time in some cases by up to 50%
2. Removed data for i-C4H10, C4H10, H2S, and c-C3H6, as no Langmuir relation constants exist for them
3. Added logic to invert the Hu-Lee-Sum Td correlation
4. Started work on a Langmuir Parameter generator
5. Improved Henry's Law Coefficient Calculation
