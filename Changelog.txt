1. Using scipy.optimization.fsolve() to search for equilibrium pressure, with significant (4.4x w/ CH4) speed increase
2. Simulation will now attempt to find an equilibrium pressure for both structures, but will return infinity if calculation does not converge
3. Simulation now records and returns the hydrate structure at each equilibrium point
4. Simulation now records and returns the hydrate occupancy at each equilibrium point for each shell and guest
5. If guest has parameters for both SI and SII hydrates, simulation will calculate with parameters based on structure
6. Cyclopropane will now converge properly
7. Webapp now accepts csv temperature and guess pressure files, as well as providing a template
8. Webapp now returns the equilibrium structure and occupancies of the hydrate shells
