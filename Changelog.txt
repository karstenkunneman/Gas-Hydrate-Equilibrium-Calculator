1. Separated commandline and functoins into separate files; renamed simulation.py to simFunctions.py
2. Improvements made to Data.xlsx formatting and sourcing
3. Fixed kappa1 parameter for isobutane
4. Altered the vapor pressure constants, improving accuracy for most calculations
5. Commandline program now assumes last mole fraction based on other mole fractions
6. Webapp no longer prompts user for mole fraction in single-component system (assuming 1)
