1. Fixed an issue where the commandline would crash if given multiple components
2. Fixed an issue where the webapp would crash if given a single component
3. Updated the Chemgroup of n-Butane
4. Added calculation for the langmuir guest-guest interaction factor, significantly improving multicomponent calculations
5. Updated some variables to better fit altered formulas
6. Commandline program now reads from Data.xlsx to get IDs and Compounds instead of being hardwritten in code
7. Commandline can now accept single guess temperature and pressure
8. Replaced old langmuir constant calculation with faster constant-based solution
